Stampede3630 Shuffleboard Plugins
<p> There is a steep but rewarding learning curve that I don't wish on the rest of you.  If you want to learn more about creating your own custom plugin, navigate <a href "https://github.com/Stampede3630/ShuffleBoardPlugins/blob/master/routineSelector/src/main/java/edu/stampede3630/routineSelector/App.java"> here </a>, it will lead to the first file that will be created when you create your maven project in VS code.  On that note you will need to create a "quickstart" maven project that the first youtube link will guide you through.  The important file that helps import all those darn packages and dependencies can be found here: <a href "https://github.com/Stampede3630/ShuffleBoardPlugins/blob/master/routineSelector/pom.xml"> pom.xml </a>

Welcome to my readme.  All my learnings were from these two sources, and of course google:
